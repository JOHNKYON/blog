## Why do I start to write blogs?

Well, This blog is more like a personal notebook that helps myself to get a review to those things I liked and tried. Explaining something to others help me exam if I do really understand it or not, and as I have no cats that I can explain my work to  so far (But I'll have a cat one day), I decide to start to write this blog and I'd be happy if you wanna discuss about anything with me.

## What will this blog mainly be about?

Most time this blog would be for technical issues, scientific problems (computer science and math mostly) and software engineering problems, but there's still a possibility that I get crazy and write some stupid funny stuffs.

Oh, if I really get a cat, this blog will have a new chapter called CAT with cat photos.
